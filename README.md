# TrainZ

Basic assumption of this project is to create a stress relief skeleton game that includes different mathemtical concepts such as splines or bezier curves, different tools such as p5.js or spline 3D engine. We are creating this game
for fun so we also seek for your advises.

## To-do

Here is our [project kanban](https://trello.com/b/b7BRmqUO/pociongz)

## Creation steps

<ol>
  <li>Figuring out how to create (and create actually) map, using Perlin Noise, like in this [Rachelf project](https://github.com/RachelfTech/procedural-terrain-generation),</li>
  <li>Figuring out which tool should we use to display our map in 3D (probably [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)) and actually do it,</li>
  <li>Figuring out which engine should we use (maybe [Spline](https://spline.design/) to transfer our 3D model and start working on the interaction itself</li>
  <li>To do continued I think? Will continue it depending on what will be teh next part in our project because we can be going backwards at this point and refractor everything but it is also a chance that
  it will work so this point will be creation of rails model, its curving etc.</li>
</ol>
